## 🔬 About Me
I'm a Ph.D. scholar and experienced research/data scientist with **5+ years** of expertise in **Deep Learning, Large Language Models (LLMs), and Data Privacy**. My work primarily focuses on optimizing and fine-tuning **Transformer-based models** and **LLMs** for **textual and graph-based datasets**. I have **20+ publications** in top-tier conferences and journals, spanning **Geospatial Analysis, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Prompt Engineering, and NLP**.

I love building **AI-driven solutions** that address privacy concerns, optimize ML models, and enhance decision-making through advanced algorithms. 🚀
